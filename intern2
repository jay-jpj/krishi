To determine the period of the sequence generated by the Galois Feedback Nonlinear Shift Register (GFNLFSR) in the above code, we need to analyze the feedback functions and the register length. 

In the provided code, the register length is 16 bits (based on the length of the seed), and there are three custom feedback functions: `custom_feedback_func_1`, `custom_feedback_func_2`, and `custom_feedback_func_3`.

The period of the sequence generated by the GFNLFSR is the maximum possible length of the sequence before it starts repeating. The period depends on the feedback functions, the tap positions, and the initial seed values.

Since the code does not explicitly specify the tap positions, it is not possible to determine the exact period without that information. The period can vary depending on the specific feedback functions, the tap positions within the register, and the initial seed values.

To determine the period, you would need to analyze the feedback functions and tap positions, looking for any repeating patterns or cycles that may occur. By examining the feedback logic and the register length, you can try to identify any cycles or repeating patterns in the generated sequence.

Alternatively, if you provide the specific tap positions or any additional constraints, I can help you analyze the period of the GFNLFSR in more detail.
